# text-parser

This parser is able to parse text into paragraphs, paragraphs into sentences, sentences into words, and words into symbols, with which it can work. To do this, it uses the [composite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern) and [chain of responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern) patterns. 

It is also able to recognize words, punctuation marks, various mathematical expressions and logical operations and calculate them using [reverse Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).

You can see examples of how the text parser works in the [logs](https://github.com/Konstantsiy/text-parser/blob/main/logs/log.txt).
